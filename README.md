- Hi, I’m @oganm-hdfs
- I’m a doctoral student in Human Development and Family Science. I'm interested in stress and romantic relationships, especially financial stress such as poverty.
- I'm also a *big* basketball fan (shouts to @owenlhjphillips for the F5). `Dort` and `Poku` stan for life.
- I’m currently learning all things data science and visualization (as hobby and potential career).
- I’m looking to collaborate on all things data science and visualization.
